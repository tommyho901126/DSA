Balance game design In game design balance is the concept and the practice of tuning a game s rules usually with the goal of preventing any of its component systems from being ineffective or otherwise undesirable when compared to their peers An unbalanced system represents wasted development resources at the very least and at worst can undermine the game s entire ruleset by making important roles or tasks impossible to perform 1 Balancing does not necessarily mean making a game fair This is particularly true of action games Jaime Griesemer design lead at Bungie said in a lecture to other designers that every fight in Halo is unfair 2 This potential for unfairness creates uncertainty leading to the tension and excitement that action games seek to deliver 3 4 1 In these cases balancing is instead the management of unfair scenarios with the ultimate goal of ensuring that all of the strategies which the game intends to support are viable 2 The extent to which those strategies are equal to one another defines the character of the game in question Simulation games can be balanced unfairly in order to be true to life A wargame may cast the player into the role of a general who was defeated by an overwhelming force and it is common for the abilities of teams in sports games to mirror those of the real world teams they represent regardless of the implications for players who pick them Digital games often allow players to influence their balance by offering a choice of difficulty levels 5 These affect how challenging the game is to play In addition to altering the game s rules difficulty levels can be used to alter what content is presented to the player This usually takes the form of adding or removing challenging location or events but some games also change their narrative to reward players who play them on higher difficulty levels Max Payne 2 or end early as punishment for playing on easy Castlevania Difficulty selection is not always presented bluntly particularly in competitive games where all players are affected equally and the standard easy hard terminology no longer applies Sometimes veiled language is used Mario Kart offers CC select while at other times there may be an array of granular settings instead of an overarching difficulty option An alternative approach to difficulty levels is catering to players of all abilities at the same time a technique that has been called subjective difficulty 6 This requires a game to provide multiple solutions or routes each offering challenges appropriate to players of different skill levels Super Mario Galaxy Sonic Generations Difficulty can also be managed by a third party or the game itself see the Gamemaster section below Balancing goals shift dramatically when players are contending with the game s environment and or non player characters Such player versus environment games are usually balanced to tread the fine line of regularly challenging players abilities without ever producing insurmountable or unfair obstacles 4 This turns balancing into the management of dramatic structure 3 generally referred to by game designers as pacing Pacing is also a consideration in competitive games but the autonomy of players makes it harder to control The simplest game balancing technique is giving each player identical resources Most competitive games feature some level of symmetry some such as Pong are completely symmetric but those in which players alternate turns such as Chess can never achieve total symmetry as one player will always have a first move advantage Symmetry can be undone by human psychology The advantage of players wearing red over players wearing blue is a well documented example of this 7 8 The brute force approach to balancing is the mathematical analysis of game session results With enough data it is possible to identify unbalanced areas of a game and make corrections Randomisation of starting conditions is a technique common in board games card games and also experimental research 9 which fights back against the human tendency to optimise patterns in one s favour 2 The downside of randomisation is that it takes control away from the player potentially leading to frustration Methods of overcoming this include giving the player a selection of random results within which they can optimise Scrabble Magic The Gathering and making each game session short enough to encourage multiple attempts in one play session Klondike solitaire Strange Adventures in Infinite Space Many games become more challenging if the player is successful For instance real time strategy games often feature upkeep a resource tax that scales with the number of units under a player s control 10 Team games which challenge players to invade their opponents territory football capture the flag have a feedback loop by default the further a player pushes the more opponents they are likely to face Feedback loops can lead to frequent ties if enforced too strictly See also Dynamic game difficulty balancing A game can be balanced dynamically by a gamemaster who observes players and adjusts the game in response to their emotional state Dungeons Dragons Left 4 Dead Although gamemasters have historically been humans some videogames now feature AI systems that perform a similar role by monitoring player ability and inferring emotional state from input 4 Research into biofeedback peripherals is set to greatly improve the accuracy of such systems 11 In role playing game slang a gimp is a character character class or character ability that is underpowered in the context of the game Gimped characters lack effectiveness compared to other characters at a similar level of experience 12 A player may gimp a character by assigning skills and abilities that are inappropriate for the character class or by developing the character inefficiently 13 However this is not always the case as some characters are purposely gimped by the game s developers in order to provide an incentive for raising their level or conversely to give the player an early head start An example of this is Final Fantasy s Mystic Knight class which starts out weak but is able to become the most powerful class if brought to a very high level Gimps may also be accidental on the part of the developer and may require a software patch to rebalance Sometimes especially in MMORPGs gimp is used as a synonym for nerf to describe a rule modification that weakens the affected target Unlike the connotatively neutral term nerf citation needed gimp in this usage often implies that the rule change unfairly disadvantages the target 14 A nerf is a change to a game that reduces the desirability or effectiveness of a particular game element The term is also used as a verb for the act of making such a change 15 The first established use of the term was in Ultima Online as a reference to the NERF brand of toys which are soft and less likely to cause serious injury 16 17 Among game developers MMORPG designers are especially likely to nerf aspects of a game in order to maintain game balance Occasionally a new feature such as an item class or skill may be made too powerful too cheap or too easily obtained to the extent that it unbalances the game system This is sometimes due to an unforeseen bug or method of using or acquiring the object that was not considered by the developers 16 18 The frequency of nerfing and the scale of nerfing vary widely from game to game but almost all massively multiplayer games have engaged in nerfing at some point 18 Nerfs in various online games including Anarchy Online have spurred in world protests 17 Since many items in virtual worlds are sold or traded among players a nerf may have an outsized impact on the virtual economy As players respond the nerf may cause prices to fluctuate before settling down in a different equilibrium This impact on the economy along with the original impact of the nerf can cause large player resentment for even a small change 17 18 In particular in the case of items or abilities which have been nerfed players can become upset over the perceived wasted efforts in obtaining the now nerfed features 17 18 A well known instance in which a nerf has caused many protests but much more praise is when Infinity Ward nerfed the Model 1887s in its video game Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Before the nerf the Model 1887s were able to One Shot Kill from medium long range when all other shotguns in game were limited to short medium range The nerfing of the Model 1887s reduced its range to short range For games where avatars and items represent significant economic value this may bring up legal issues over the lost value 19 Overpowered often abbreviated to OP is a common term referring to a perceived lack of game balance It is often used when describing a specific class in an RPG a specific faction in strategic games or a specific tactic ability weapon or unit in various games For something to be deemed overpowered it is either the best choice in a disproportionate number of situations marginalising other choices and or excessively hard to counter by the opponent compared to the effort required to use it I read the paragraph on http wikipedia org

Festus Walters Festus Walters 18491922 was an Ohio jurist and advocate for Gubernatorial judicial independence known for the controversial decision to try an Ohio National Guard commander for murder following the Washington County Courthouse riots of 1895 Among the Ohio Five arriving at Cornell University when that revolutionary institution opened its doors he was life long friends with fellow Cornellian and fraternity brother Senator Joseph B Foraker In 1898 the official history of the Republican Party in Ohio stated that t he Republican party may well be judged by its degree of intelligence its usefulness and safety in the management of public affairs and its achievements during the forty years of its existence It is a party of principle and though its opponents may criticise its doctrines they cannot deny that it has always had the courage of its convictions As long as it continues it will attract to its ranks men of brilliant minds and intellectual giants who give freely of their great gifts to aid the maintenance of a party that has done so much for the prosperity of the country Ohio has in the past contributed her share of famous men and as the years roll on the names of others are added one by one to the rapidly increasing list One that has become prominently associated with the political history of the state is that of Judge Festus Walters personally the Judge is courteous and affable and is an excellent entertainer though not a society man in the strict sense of the word 1 Festus Walters descended in the maternal line from the Peters family of Fairfield County Ohio It is unknown when the eponymous Peters ancestor landed in America or from what country Like many whose descendants settled southern Ohio he settled in Philadelphia married and sired two sons born in Philadelphia Jacob and Henry Henry died without issue Jacob married He moved south to Baltimore raising three sons and one daughter The daughter married a man named Burns The sons were John Jacob and Samuel Samuel son of Jacob and the ancestor of Ohios Judge Festus Walters was born in Philadelphia on September 27 1772 He died at his home in Amanda township Fairfield County Ohio September 10 1829 His wife was Mary Stevenson daughter of Daniel Stevenson of Baltimore County Maryland She was born September 28 1773 and died in Fairfield County February 15 1861 aged 87 years Their oldest son Henry Peters was born October 1 1796 They trekked to the Ohio valley in April 1812 and lived for five years on what became the Frank Stevenson farm Daniel Stevenson was born September 21 1737 and died September 3 1829 Ruth his wife was born January 24 1743 and died January 12 1834 They were the parents of ten children They came to Ohio several years before Peters and his wife The wife of Samuel Peters was a model woman and mother She was a daughter of Daniel Stevenson one of the early pioneers of Richland township and on whose land the first Methodist church in the county was erected The old homestead remained in the Stevenson family for many years A grandson of Daniel was the landsman when Festus Walters was sitting on the Ohio bench There were several brothers and sisters of the Stevenson family Daniel Jesse Mordecai Edward Mrs Peters who was Judge Walters grandmother and Mrs Hampson were those most remembered most of them were born in Maryland and came to Ohio with their father as early as 1803 Daniel Stevenson the pioneer and father of this large family was a very prominent man of the Republics early days and much respected for his sterling character He was a Methodist and donated land for the first church in the county He entertained the evangelist Bishop Asbury during his visits to Fairfield County and it was on his land where Asbury conducted the first camp meeting held in the county The early church was constructed of hewn logs carved with big broad axes and with a skill available to a select few of the pioneer workman and with what skill the corner men could notch the logs perfectly and carry up their corner a perilous job but performed by hundreds of men With respect to the Peters family Mr Peters and wife arrived in the Ohio valley in 1812 They settled two miles north of West Rushville on Rush Creek at the mouth of Snake run The Peters remained on Rush Creek for about five years They purchased land south of Royalton later owned by Benjamin Haas cut a farm and endured the hardships incidental to pioneer life Here they spent their lives living the quiet life of farmers and rearing a large family of children Mr Peters was a man of sterling character and possessed good business sense Peters was prominent and beloved in his neighborhood and exerted an influence in the community far above the average His success in rearing a large family to honorable and useful lives is evidence of many good qualities and ability as a parent His sons were Henry Nathan Robinson J Ebenezer Wesley Gideon Stevenson Lewis and Andrew most of whom lived to old age and all exceptionally fine business men Nine brothers possessing better business ability or more successful in business will be hard to find among the pioneers or at any other period They were stalwart men most of them of commanding presence As a commentator stated three generations later Take this family the Stevenson family the Beery family where can you find such large families of stalwart robust long lived men Where can we find such men even in small families Are we degenerating 2 These men were the uncles of Judge Festus Walters Henry Peters at an early day moved to Marion County When the Wyandotte Indians transferred their lands he moved to Wyandot County He was a good man a sagacious man He prospered and made good investments He died in Upper Sandusky and left to his heirs an ample estate Upon the death of his brother Gideon he took charge of his children and reared them and at his death they were well remembered Brother Nathan Peters moved to Marion County at an early date He engaged in farming for a number of years and was successful His old age was spent in Marion where he owned a fine home Nathans son Harvey was for many years a Marion leading druggist Ebenezer Peters moved at an early day to Marion County where he was a prosperous farmer and stock dealer Like all of his brothers he was a good business man and respected and honored by his neighbors He died at an advanced age In middle age he resided in Marion where he took an active part in politics and assisted in electing Samuel A Griswold county auditor The Peters name is prevalent in Marion and Upper Sandusky Stevenson and Lewis became farmers and located in Pickaway County near Nebraska P O Like their brothers they were successful in business accumulated property and lived in good style They were among the prominent members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in that vicinity Lewis Peters was an unusually intelligent man of good social qualities and a man of influence and very highly esteemed One of his sons married a daughter of Rev John W White of Lancaster Ohio and resided in Upper Sandusky A son of Lewis Peters and cousin to Judge Festus Walters was the Honorable S R Peters of Newton Kansas an old Pickaway County boy born in Walnut township in 1842 seven years before Judge Walters S R Peters was a graduate of Delaware University Ohio Wesleyan and served through the war as a member of the Seventy third regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry mustering out of the service as captain He went to Kansas following the war and in a little over a year after arriving he began his political career He was a member of the Kansas State Senate judge of the Ninth Judicial District a very trying region to hold court Judge S R Peters was three times elected to the difficult position without opposition In 1883 he was elected at large to the Forty Eighth United States Congress In 1890 he declined further congressional honors preferring to practice his profession Judge Peters became the postmaster at Newton Kansas and editor of the Kansas Republican published in that city He also practiced law Judge Peters wife was Amelia C Doan daughter of Rev John Doan and they were married in Circleville in April 1867 Mrs Peters was a universal favorite in Washington D C society during their residence in that city Judge Peters great aunt Mary Peters married Daniel Walters and they spent their lives upon a farm in Amanda township Judge Festus Walters of the Common Pleas Court of Circleville was their son He has attained quite a prominent position at the bar 3 Walters was born in Fairfield County Ohio September 30 1849 the son of Daniel and Mary Peters Walters Dan Walters was of German descent and Mary Peters was of English descent Walters father was a farmer by occupation and in politics he voted the Whig ticket His death occurred in 1855 when Walters was six years old Walters spent his boyhood days mostly as an assistant to his father working on the farm and attending the district school two months in the year He remained at home until age sixteen when he entered the Ohio University at Athens to prepare for college After finishing the preparatory course he attended the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware studying there until 1868 when he transferred as a junior to Cornell University from which he was graduated in 1870 Walters pursued his Cornell studies with the definite purpose of taking up the profession of law He was among the Ohio men founding the Cornell chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity the first Chapter north of the Susquehanna and east of the Ohio rivers He was a member Irving Literary Society Immediately after leaving Cornell University he began a course in the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor Walters was graduated from Michigan Law in 1872 The next year he passed examination and was admitted to the bar at Columbus Ohio and at once went to Circleville where he began the practice of his profession Fresh out of Michigan law Walter challenged Michigan classmate J P Winstead 72 in the election for Pickaway County Ohios prosecuting attorney position He lost 4 Walters was married December 21 1876 to Miss May E Wilkes of Circleville and they had seven children Walters practiced law in the 1870s and 1880s The habits of industry formed in his youth he carried with him in his mature years and when he entered into a case he gave it time labor and the best efforts of his well trained mind Being a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners having a strong logical mind and being a fluent and concise speaker he early in his career took a position in the front rank of Ohios Pickaway County bar His whole time and attention was given to his profession and during the last ten years of his practice there was but little important litigation in the local courts in which he did not actively participate on one side or the other His practice was general and extended into the county state and federal courts In referring to the professional side of his life one of the oldest and ablest members of the Pickaway Ccounty bar has this to say of Judge Walters Great lawyers like great poets are born not made and Judge Walters belongs to that class of men who were born with a natural aptitude for the legal profession His natural gifts have been supplemented by a careful and systematic course of training and he is recognized as one of the able lawyers of the state Had his lot been cast in a larger center of population where greater opportunities present themselves he undoubtedly would have risen to much greater prominence but he is still comparatively young and his light will in time grow brighter His mind has a legal trend and is well stored with an accurate knowledge of the principles of law He possesses in a remarkable degree the elements of a good lawyer is a fluent talker a logical reasoner and has quick perceptions and sound judgment He is clear accurate impartial and firm and no man ever sat on the bench who inspired greater confidence to the practitioners at the bar than does Judge Walters 5 Walters was a delegate to the 1888 Republican Partys National Convention in Chicago 6 In the fall of 1894 he at the earnest solicitations of his party friends accepted the nomination for common pleas judge of the second subdivision fifth judicial district which was then unanimously unanimously tendered him The nomination was recognized as a most fitting one and he was elected over Judge I N Abernethy the Democratic candidate by a majority of two thousand and eight hundred votes The Second Subdivision covered Highland Fayette Madison Ross and Pickaway counties He was reelected to the Court of Common Pleas in1899 Walters took his seat on the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County in February 1891 and had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888 In 1892 he was a candidate for the United States Congress but failed to be nominated From 1875 through to the end of the century Judge Walters was a worker in all the Presidential campaigns under the state committees and acquired a reputation for being a powerful stump speaker Fetus Walters was a personal friend of J B Foraker and it was well known that he attended the same school which as Senator Foraker Judge Bookwater sic of Cincinnati why use sic outside a quote Judge Spence and J P Ray sic J A Rae at Delaware and at Cornell University At Cornell Foraker Buchwalter Spence and Ray were all a year ahead of Walters All five were brothers of the New York Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi Walters was also one of the assignees of Q E Sears Company canners and was later manager of the estate He favored a protective tariff and a gold
